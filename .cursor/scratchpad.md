# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to redesign the current visited places screen (`src/app/visited.tsx`) to be a proper visited places screen inspired by the "Been" app. The current implementation has basic map functionality but lacks the polish and features expected from a travel tracking app.

Key requirements:

- Transform into a proper visited places screen similar to Been app
- Use placeholder data instead of implementing backend logic
- The view is displayed in a modal
- Focus on UI/UX design and user experience

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Been App Analysis**: The Been app is known for its beautiful, engaging interface that gamifies travel tracking with:

   - World map with country/region coverage visualization
   - Statistics and achievements
   - Visual progress indicators
   - Clean, modern design
   - Engaging animations and interactions

2. **Current State Issues**:

   - Basic map implementation without visual appeal
   - Limited statistics or gamification elements
   - No proper empty states or onboarding
   - Missing key Been-app features like country coverage, travel stats, etc.

3. **Modal Context**: Being in a modal means we need to:
   - Optimize for mobile viewing
   - Include proper modal navigation/close actions
   - Ensure content fits well in modal constraints

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Planning and Design Analysis

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Analyze Been app features and create component structure
  - Success Criteria: Clear breakdown of UI components needed
  - Estimated Time: Planning phase

### Phase 2: Create Placeholder Data Structure

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Create comprehensive placeholder data
  - Success Criteria: Rich, realistic data for testing all UI states
  - Components: Countries visited, cities, travel stats, achievements

### Phase 3: Header and Navigation Design

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Design modal header with statistics summary
  - Success Criteria: Clean header with key stats (countries visited, cities, etc.)
  - Features: Modal close button, title, key metrics

### Phase 4: Map Visualization Enhancement

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Enhance map with country/region coverage visualization
  - Success Criteria: Visually appealing map showing visited regions
  - Features: Country highlighting, better markers, zoom interactions

### Phase 5: Statistics and Achievements Section

- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Create travel statistics dashboard
  - Success Criteria: Engaging stats display with progress indicators
  - Features: Country count, continent progress, travel badges

### Phase 6: List View and Details

- [ ] **Task 6.1**: Create list view toggle for visited places
  - Success Criteria: Clean list with photos, dates, and details
  - Features: Search, filter, detailed place cards

### Phase 7: Empty State and Onboarding

- [ ] **Task 7.1**: Design compelling empty state
  - Success Criteria: Motivational empty state that encourages exploration
  - Features: Illustration, call-to-action, progress visualization

### Phase 8: Polish and Animations

- [ ] **Task 8.1**: Add micro-interactions and polish
  - Success Criteria: Smooth, engaging user experience
  - Features: Animations, haptics, loading states
