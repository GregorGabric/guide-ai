# Project Restructuring: Feature-Based Organization

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested help organizing their React Native/Expo project structure to be feature-based. Currently, the project follows a mixed organizational pattern with some components organized by type (`_components/`, `services/`, `convex/`) and others by routing structure (`(tabs)/`, `(api)/`).

**Current Project Type**: React Native/Expo app with:

- AI-powered travel guide functionality
- Location-based services (maps, places)
- Chat/messaging features
- Attraction discovery and carousel displays
- Convex backend integration
- Expo Router for navigation

**Current Structure Issues**:

- Components scattered across `app/_components/`, `components/`, and mixed with pages
- Business logic split between `services/`, `convex/`, and components
- No clear feature boundaries
- Mixed concerns in file organization

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Identified Features/Domains:

1. **Places/Attractions** - Core feature for discovering and displaying locations

   - Files: `services/places/`, `convex/places.ts`, `convex/placesActions.ts`, `app/_components/attraction-*`
   - Includes: place search, display, carousel, bottom sheets, map integration

2. **AI Chat** - Conversational interface for travel assistance

   - Files: `app/_components/ai-chat/`, `convex/chat.ts`, `convex/messages.ts`
   - Includes: chat interface, message handling, streaming

3. **Maps/Location** - Geographic and navigation functionality

   - Files: Location logic in `app/index.tsx`, map components
   - Includes: map display, location services, navigation

4. **Text-to-Speech** - Audio/voice functionality

   - Files: `convex/textToSpeech.ts`
   - Includes: speech synthesis

5. **Shared/Core** - Common utilities and components
   - Files: `components/ui/`, `lib/`, `utils/`, `store/`
   - Includes: UI primitives, themes, utilities, state management

### Technical Considerations:

- Expo Router file-based routing must be preserved in `app/` directory
- Convex backend files should stay in `convex/` for deployment compatibility
- Shared UI components need to remain accessible across features
- Import paths will need systematic updating

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Milestone Achieved**: Phase 4 Task 4.1 Complete! ðŸŽ‰

**Summary of Changes**:

- Successfully moved all feature-specific components to their new organized locations
- Updated all import statements to reference the new paths
- No import-related errors remaining (confirmed by linter)
- Cleaned up old unused imports and empty directories

**Ready for Testing**: The app should now run with the new feature-based structure. The remaining linter errors are unrelated to our reorganization (missing dependencies and icon files).

**Recommendation**: The user should test the app by running `npm start` to ensure all functionality still works correctly with the new organization.

**Progress**: Phase 2 (Core Feature Extraction) and Phase 4 Task 4.1 (Import Path Updates) are now complete - approximately 70% of the reorganization is finished!

## Lessons

- User prefers no barrel files (index.ts exports) for cleaner structure
- TypeScript errors need proper error handling when concatenating unknown types in template literals
- Import paths must be updated systematically after moving files to avoid broken references
- Linter can effectively identify remaining import issues that need resolution
- Feature extraction works well when done incrementally with immediate import updates

# Legend List Integration

## Background and Motivation

Integrating Legend List to replace the current ScrollView in the AI chat component for better performance and chat-specific features. Legend List provides:

- Better performance for dynamic message heights
- Built-in `maintainScrollAtEnd` for chat UIs
- `alignItemsAtEnd` for proper content alignment
- Superior scroll management without manual position tracking

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Converting from ScrollView-based message rendering to LegendList's renderItem pattern
- Adapting message components to work with list items
- Handling different item types (messages, placeholder, clear button)
- Maintaining existing functionality like audio controls and scroll behavior

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] Install @legendapp/list package
- [x] Update imports to include LegendList components
- [x] Replace ScrollView with LegendList in AI chat component
- [x] Transform message data into LegendList-compatible format
- [x] Implement renderItem function for different message types
- [x] Configure Legend List with chat-appropriate props (maintainScrollAtEnd, alignItemsAtEnd)
- [x] Update AIMessage component to make scrollViewRef optional
- [ ] Test the implementation with different scenarios
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works correctly

## Project Status Board

- âœ… Package installation completed
- âœ… Component refactoring completed
- âœ… Type compatibility issues resolved
- ðŸ”„ Testing phase - ready for manual testing

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

Successfully integrated Legend List into the AI chat component. The implementation includes:

- LegendList with proper chat configuration (maintainScrollAtEnd, alignItemsAtEnd)
- Transformed message rendering to use renderItem pattern
- Support for placeholder messages and clear button
- Maintained existing audio controls and scroll behavior
- Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

Integration complete! The AI chat component now uses Legend List with the following benefits:

- `maintainScrollAtEnd={true}` - automatically keeps scroll at bottom when new messages arrive
- `alignItemsAtEnd={true}` - aligns content to bottom for proper chat UX
- `maintainScrollAtEndThreshold={0.1}` - maintains scroll position when user is near bottom
- Better performance for dynamic message heights
- Simplified scroll management (no need for manual scrollToEnd calls)

Ready for user testing to verify all functionality works as expected.

## Lessons

- Legend List provides excellent chat-specific features out of the box
- The renderItem pattern requires transforming data but provides better performance
- Making component props optional helps with API flexibility during refactoring
