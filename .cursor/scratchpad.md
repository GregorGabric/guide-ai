## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Status**: Phase 1 Implementation In Progress - Core backend functionality implemented

**Completed Implementation**:

1. ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Added `visitedPlaces` and `visitStats` tables to Convex schema with proper indexing
2. ‚úÖ **Backend Functions**: Created comprehensive Convex functions in `visitedPlaces.ts`:
   - `recordVisit` - Records new visits with duplicate prevention
   - `getVisitedPlaces` - Retrieves all visited places
   - `getVisitStats` - Gets aggregated statistics
   - `addManualVisit` - Allows manual place addition
3. ‚úÖ **UI Components**:

   - Added visited places button to bottom tabs
   - Updated tab navigation structure
4. ‚úÖ **Automatic Tracking**: Added visit recording logic to attraction bottom sheet (pending Convex API regeneration)

**Current Blockers**:

- Convex API needs to be regenerated to include new `visitedPlaces` functions
- Some type errors in visited places screen due to missing API

**Ready for Next Steps**:

- Need to run Convex development server to regenerate API
- Complete automatic visit tracking integration
- Add manual place addition functionality

**Project Overview**: This is a new major feature addition to the Guide AI app. The visited places tracking feature will add significant value by:

- Providing visual travel history through an interactive 3D globe
- Automatically tracking user engagement with places
- Enabling manual curation of travel experiences
- Displaying meaningful statistics about user's exploration

**Technical Architecture Decisions Needed**:

1. **3D Globe Library Selection**:

   - Options: React Native Three.js, react-native-maps with 3D, Expo GL, Web-based solution in WebView
   - Considerations: Performance, bundle size, platform compatibility, ease of implementation

2. **Database Schema Design**:

   ```typescript
   // Proposed schema additions:
   visitedPlaces: {
     placeId: string,  // Reference to existing places
     userId: string,   // If user system exists
     visitedAt: number,
     visitType: 'automatic' | 'manual',
     coordinates: { lat: number, lng: number },
     placeName: string,
     placeAddress?: string,
     notes?: string,
     photos?: string[], // File IDs
   }

   visitStats: {
     userId: string,
     totalVisits: number,
     uniquePlaces: number,
     countriesVisited: string[],
     citiesVisited: string[],
     lastUpdated: number,
   }
   ```

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Hook into `AttractionBottomSheet` component for automatic tracking
   - Add new tab or screen for globe view
   - Integrate with existing location services
   - Connect with places search functionality

**Integration Analysis Complete**:

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I've identified key integration points:

1. **Automatic Visit Tracking**: The `AttractionBottomSheet` component (`src/features/places/components/attraction-bottom-sheet.tsx`) is triggered when users interact with attractions. This is the perfect place to automatically record visits.

2. **Existing Database Structure**:

   - `places` table with comprehensive place data including coordinates
   - `messages` table linked to locationId for chat functionality
   - Current schema supports Google Places API data

3. **Navigation Structure**:

   - App uses Expo Router with tabs (`src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`)
   - Currently has placeholder tabs that can be replaced with our visited places feature
   - Main map screen at `src/app/index.tsx` handles attraction selection

4. **Technical Stack Already Present**:
   - Convex database with TypeScript support
   - React Native Maps for 2D mapping
   - Reanimated 3 for animations
   - TanStack Query for data fetching
   - Expo for cross-platform development

**Recommended Architecture**:

- Add `visitedPlaces` table to existing Convex schema
- Hook into `AttractionBottomSheet` mounting to trigger visit recording
- Replace one of the placeholder tabs with visited places globe
- Use react-native-three.js or WebGL for 3D globe implementation

**Next Steps**:

1. Begin Phase 1 with database schema design and automatic visit tracking
2. Research optimal 3D globe library (leaning toward react-three-fiber for React Native)
3. Implement visit recording in attraction bottom sheet component
