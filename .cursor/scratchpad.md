# Permission Management Screen Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to add a permission management screen that appears as part of the onboarding flow. This screen should request all permissions required by the app.

Based on the current app structure and existing code analysis, this Guide AI app requires the following permissions:

- **Location Services** (already partially implemented): For discovering nearby places and map functionality
- **Camera Access** (already partially implemented): For camera features and photo capture
- **Microphone Access** (configured in app.json): For audio recording/playback features
- **Media Library Access** (potentially needed): For saving/accessing photos and audio files

Currently, permission handling is scattered across different components (bottom-tabs.tsx, camera.tsx, \_layout.tsx) with individual permission requests. A centralized onboarding permission screen would provide a better user experience by:

1. Explaining why each permission is needed
2. Requesting all permissions upfront
3. Providing a consistent and professional onboarding experience
4. Allowing users to understand the app's functionality before granting access

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:

1. **Navigation Flow Integration**: Need to determine how to integrate the permission screen into the existing navigation structure without breaking current routing
2. **Permission State Management**: Need to track permission status across the app and handle different permission states (granted, denied, undetermined)
3. **Platform Differences**: iOS and Android have different permission behaviors and requirements
4. **Existing Permission Logic**: Current permission handling is scattered - need to consolidate and refactor existing code
5. **Onboarding Flow Design**: Need to determine when and how to show the permission screen (first launch, after updates, etc.)

### UX/Design Challenges:

1. **Permission Rationale**: Need clear, compelling explanations for why each permission is needed
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle cases where users deny permissions and provide fallback experiences
3. **Visual Design**: Create an engaging, trustworthy permission screen that follows the app's design system
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Potentially show permissions one at a time vs. all at once

### Business Logic Challenges:

1. **Required vs Optional**: Determine which permissions are absolutely required vs. nice-to-have
2. **Retry Logic**: Handle cases where users initially deny permissions but later want to grant them
3. **Settings Integration**: Provide easy access to system settings for permission changes

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Status**: Task 1.1 COMPLETED - Permission audit and centralized configuration created

**Completed Work**:

1. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Permission Audit**: Analyzed all existing permission usage across the codebase
2. ‚úÖ **Created Centralized Configuration**: Built `src/lib/permissions.ts` with comprehensive permission management types and configuration
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Documented current implementation patterns and technical debt
4. ‚úÖ **Permission Screen UI Design**: Created `src/components/permission-screen.tsx` with native iOS-style design
5. ‚úÖ **Permission Management Hook**: Built `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts` for centralized permission state management
6. ‚úÖ **Onboarding Flow Integration**: Designed and implemented complete onboarding flow strategy

**Key Findings from Task 1.1**:

- **Location Permission**: Used in 3 files (`_layout.tsx`, `camera.tsx`, `useLocation.ts`) - Currently scattered implementation
- **Camera Permission**: Used in 2 files (`bottom-tabs.tsx`, `camera.tsx`) - Basic implementation with react-native-vision-camera
- **Microphone Permission**: Only configured in `app.json` - Not checked in code yet
- **Media Library**: Not implemented yet but potentially needed

**Task 1.2 Deliverables**:

- **PermissionScreen Component**: Clean, native iOS-style permission list with:
  - Welcome message and clear explanation
  - Visual status indicators (checkmarks, loading spinners, empty circles)
  - Clean typography using existing design system
  - Responsive layout with safe area handling
  - Continue button that's disabled until required permissions are granted
- **usePermissions Hook**: Centralized permission management with:
  - State management for all permission types
  - Individual permission request functions
  - Batch permission checking and requesting
  - Error handling with system settings integration
  - Loading states

**Task 1.3 Deliverables**:

- **Onboarding State Management**: Created `src/hooks/useOnboarding.ts` with:
  - Persistent storage using AsyncStorage and Zustand
  - Version-based onboarding migration system
  - First-launch detection with fallback handling
  - Complete/reset functionality for development and testing
- **OnboardingWrapper Component**: Built `src/components/onboarding-wrapper.tsx` with:
  - Conditional rendering logic (permission screen vs main app)
  - Integration with permission management
  - Seamless transition handling
  - Loading states and error handling
- **Root Layout Integration**: Updated `src/app/_layout.tsx` to:
  - Wrap main navigation with onboarding logic
  - Maintain existing navigation structure
  - Preserve backward compatibility
  - Clean separation of concerns

**Integration Strategy Design**:

1. **Non-Intrusive Approach**: OnboardingWrapper acts as a conditional renderer without changing existing navigation
2. **Persistent State**: Uses AsyncStorage + Zustand for reliable cross-session onboarding state
3. **Version-Based**: Onboarding can be re-triggered for app updates with new permissions
4. **Permission-Driven**: Only completes onboarding when required permissions are granted
5. **Development-Friendly**: Easy to reset onboarding for testing purposes

**Navigation Flow**:

1. App launches ‚Üí OnboardingWrapper checks state
2. If first launch or version mismatch ‚Üí Shows PermissionScreen
3. User grants required permissions ‚Üí Onboarding marked complete
4. Future launches ‚Üí Directly shows main app navigation
5. App updates with new permissions ‚Üí Re-triggers onboarding flow

**Next Steps**:

1. Ready to proceed with Phase 2: Core Implementation
2. Task 2.1: Create centralized permission management service/hook (‚úÖ Already completed in usePermissions.ts)
3. Ready for Task 2.2: Implement permission screen UI components (‚úÖ Already completed)
4. Ready for Task 2.3: Integrate permission screen into onboarding flow (‚úÖ Already completed)

**Status**: **Phase 1 COMPLETE** - All foundational work finished ahead of schedule
**Recommended Next Steps**: Move directly to Phase 3 (Integration and Refinement) or Phase 4 (Testing and Polish)
